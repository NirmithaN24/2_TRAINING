    Consider there is a scenario, where we are having the scores of players(Batsmen) in a cricket match. 
    We get a total of 11 values as inputs and we need to find the player who can be the payer of the match.
    Take number of players as input1.
    Take scores for all of those players.
    Find the player with highest scores and declare them as POTM.
    Find the player with the lowest score and wish them all the best.
    Find the total score of the team and target score for opponent.
